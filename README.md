••• KINECT-AMX •••


•• This is a multi thread WPF application that integrates the Microsoft Kinect sensor with AMX classroom automation system. It uses 
Visual Studio, C#.NET, and Kinect SDK environment together with AMX API to control classroom equipment by voice, supporting features 
such as controlling the classroom camera, volume, input source, projector screen, and more.


• What I Did on the Project

1-> Understand the manager's idea, and come up with a code concept/design to implement it.

2-> Research/learn about Kinect sdk and AMX language(both unknown to me in the beginning), and how to integrate them in a WPF app.

3-> Design a very simple Gui for the occasional end-user ip changes.

4-> Write all WPF app(source code folder) using C#.NET, as well as a minor part of Amx code for the hardware side.

5-> Provide training and create documentation(manuals, FAQs) for end-users and future reference.


Note: The Amx part of the project was proprietary code so I can't share, but the tutorial pdf shows how to set up the Kinect integration part into the Amx .axs files.
