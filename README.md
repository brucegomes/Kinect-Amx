# KINECT-AMX

### A classroom hardware automation controlled by voice commands through the MS Kinect Sensor.

#### This is a multi-thread WPF application that integrates the Microsoft Kinect sensor with AMX classroom automation system. It uses Visual Studio, C#.NET, and Kinect SDK environment together with AMX API to control classroom equipment by voice, supporting features such as controlling the classroom camera, volume, input source, projector screen, and more.


## What I Did on the Project

- Understand the manager's idea, and come up with a code concept/design to achieve his objective.

- Research/learn about Kinect sdk and AMX API, and how to integrate them in a wpf app.

- Design a very simple Gui for the occasional end-user IP changes. Not a focus on this project

- Write all wpf app(source code folder) using C#.NET, as well as a minor part of Amx code for the hardware side.

- Provide training and create documentation(manuals, FAQs) for end-users and future reference.

> **Note:** The Amx part of the project was proprietary code so I can't share, but the [Manual_ReadMe](./Manual_ReadMe.pdf) is a good illustration on how to set up the Kinect integration part into the Amx ".axs" files.

#### Possible expansions are Gesture control and profile automation using face recognition.
